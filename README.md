# CHT-Nucleate
Code for Conjugate Heat Transfer Model using unsteady 1-D heat equation. The Crank-Nicolson scheme was used to numerically solve the heat equation, whilst applying appropriate boundary conditions. The phenomenon of Interfacial Heat Transfer Resistance could be added accordingly but has not been coded into the code.
PSI-BOIL is used to keep track of the time during the processing of the code, it could be removed and replaced with standard libabries.
